## Introduction

This is a simple Snake and Ladder application implemented in Java. The game allows multiple players to play on a board with snakes and ladders.

## Problem Statement

Create a snake and ladder application. The application should take as input (from the command line or a file):

- Number of snakes (s) followed by s lines each containing 2 numbers denoting the head and tail positions of the snake.
- Number of ladders (l) followed by l lines each containing 2 numbers denoting the start and end positions of the ladder.
- Number of players (p) followed by p lines each containing a name.

After taking these inputs, you should print all the moves in the form of the current player name followed by a random number between 1 to 6 denoting the die roll and the initial and final position based on the move.

When someone wins the game, print that the player won the game.

## Rules of the Game

- The board will have 100 cells numbered from 1 to 100.
- The game will have a six sided dice numbered from 1 to 6 and will always give a random number on rolling it.
- Each player has a piece which is initially kept outside the board (i.e., at position 0).
- Each player rolls the dice when their turn comes.
- Based on the dice value, the player moves their piece forward that number of cells.
- A player wins if it exactly reaches the position 100 and the game ends there.
- Snakes and Ladders modify player position according to their heads and tails.
- There could be another snake/ladder at the tail of the snake or the end position of the ladder and the piece should go up/down accordingly.

- There won‚Äôt be multiple snakes/ladders at the same start/head point.
- It is possible to reach 100, i.e., it is possible to win the game.
- Snakes and Ladders do not form an infinite loop.
